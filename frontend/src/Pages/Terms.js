                            FEES, PAYMENT TERMS AND REFUNDS You are responsible
                            for all fees for the Services in the amounts set
                            forth on the applicable Order/invoice, which may be

                            has been approved, we will provide you an invoice
                            via electronic mail no later than two (2) days after
                            the invoice date to the email address(es) designated
                            in your Order. You must keep your billing email
                            address(es) current. Billing commences on the first
                            day the Services are made available to you. Unless
                            otherwise agreed by us in writing, recurring Fees
                            will be charged/invoiced annually. Non-recurring
                            Fees will be included on the invoice for the
                            applicable installation or Service changes. You
                            waive the right to dispute any charges not disputed
                            within thirty (30) days' of a charge or invoice
                            date. You are responsible for the payment of all
                            governmental assessments, surcharges, and fees

                            taxes on our net income). We will not charge you for
                            any taxes if you provide us with valid
                            certificate(s) of exemption. If you fail to provide
                            or maintain the required tax exemption
                            certificate(s), you shall indemnify, defend and hold
                            us harmless from any damages or liability we incur,
                            and we may back-bill you for all applicable taxes.
                            We offer a limited money-back guarantee if you are
                            not satisfied with our Services, as further
                            described on our website. Please contact us prior to
                            the expiration of the guarantee if you would like to
                            request a refund. Except as otherwise provided
                            herein, all Services are non-cancellable and all
                            Fees are non-refundable, and you are not entitled to

                            SUSPENSION We may suspend some or all of the
                            Services or Sites without liability to you if: (i)
                            you fail to cure any default within the cure period
                            specified above; (ii) we determine that the Services
                            or Sites are being used, have been used, or will,
                            with commercially reasonable certainty, be used in
                            breach of this Agreement; (iii) we reasonably
                            believe that the Services or Sites have been
                            accessed or utilized in any way by a third party
                            without your consent; or (iv) suspension of Services
                            or Sites is reasonably necessary to protect us or
                            our products and services. We will use commercially
                            reasonable efforts to provide you advance notice of
                            a suspension and a chance to cure the violation on
                            which the suspension is based, unless we determine,
                            in our reasonable judgment, that an immediate
                            suspension is necessary to protect our network and
                            our customers from an imminent, significant
                            operational, network integrity or security risk.
                            Suspensions based on your breach of this Agreement
                            will not relieve your obligation to pay for the
                            suspended Services during the period of suspension.
                            Any suspension imposed under this Section will be
                            lifted upon your cure of the breach causing the
                            suspension. In the event you are unable to cure the
                            breach within fifteen (15) days of our notice, the
                            suspension may be treated as a termination for
                            cause. During the suspension period, we shall have
                            the right to deny access to, and/or, destroy data
                            stored on the compromised server or account. We may,
                            in our sole discretion, allow access to a suspended
                            account.

                            DISPUTE RESOLUTION – ARBITRATION; CLASS-ACTION
                            WAIVER, AND JURY WAIVER The exclusive means of
                            resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or
                            relating to this Agreement (including the
                            interpretation, enforcement and any alleged breach
                            thereof) or the Services or Sites shall be BINDING
                            ARBITRATION administered by JAMS under the JAMS
                            Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures. The one
                            exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that
                            either party has the right to bring an individual
                            claim against the other in a small-claims court of
                            competent jurisdiction, or, if filed in arbitration,
                            the responding party may request that the dispute
                            proceed in small claims court if the party's claim
                            is within the jurisdiction of a small claims court.
                            If the responding party requests to proceed in small
                            claims court before the appointment of the
                            arbitrator, the arbitration shall be
                            administratively closed, and if requested after the
                            appointment of the arbitrator, the arbitrator shall
                            determine if the dispute should be decided in
                            arbitration or if the arbitration should be
                            administratively closed and decided in small claims
                            court. Whether you choose arbitration or
                            small-claims court, you may not under any
                            circumstances commence or maintain against us any
                            class action, class arbitration, or other
                            representative action or proceeding. By using the
                            Services or Sites, you agree to the above
                            arbitration terms. In doing so, YOU GIVE UP THE
                            RIGHT TO GO TO COURT (except for matters that may be
                            taken to small-claims court). YOU ALSO GIVE UP THE
                            RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER
                            CLASS PROCEEDING. You understand your rights will be
                            determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR
                            JURY, and the arbitrator shall determine all issues
                            regarding the arbitrability of the dispute. The
                            arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can,
                            and decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in
                            court and may be overturned by a court only for very
                            limited reasons. Any proceeding to enforce
                            arbitration, including any proceeding to confirm,
                            modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be
                            commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction. In
                            the event that this arbitration provision is for any
                            reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation
                            against us may be commenced only in the federal or
                            state courts located in Ingham County, Michigan. You
                            hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of
                            those courts for such purposes. If any action or
                            other proceeding is brought for the enforcement of
                            this Agreement, or because of an alleged or actual
                            dispute, breach, default or misrepresentation in
                            connection with any provision of this Agreement, the
                            successful or prevailing party shall be entitled to
                            recover reasonable attorney fees and other costs
                            incurred in that action or proceeding, in addition
                            to any other relief to which it may be entitled.

                    This Agreement shall be binding on the parties and
                    respective successors and assigns. Nothing in this Agreement
                    creates, or will be deemed to create, third-party
                    beneficiaries of or under this Agreement. Nothing contained
                    in this Agreement shall be construed to create a
                    partnership, agency, joint venture, or employer/employee
                    relationship between the parties. Each party is responsible
                    for the actions of, and its obligations to, its own
                    personnel, contractors, and subcontractors. Neither party
                    shall be liable, nor shall any credit allowance or other
                    remedy be extended, for any failure of performance or

                    us for the affected Service for so long as we are unable to
                    deliver that Service. The failure by any party to this
                    Agreement to insist upon strict performance of any provision
                    of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of that
                    provision. All waivers must be in writing to be enforceable
                    hereunder. Except as otherwise provided herein, any notice

                    invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable law, that
                    provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such
                    declaration and such declaration shall not affect the
                    remaining provisions of this Agreement. The parties consent
                    and agree that this Agreement and any Order may be entered
